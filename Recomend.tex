\section{Recommender Systems} \label{sec:recommender}
PR can modified so that it can be used in recommender systems for companies such as Netflix or Amazon, this modified PR is ItemRank \cite{gleich2015pagerank}. ItemRank makes personalised product suggestions by extracting knowledge for the users prior interactions \cite{gori2007itemrank}. ItemRank is a random-walk based algorithm where users rate the items, and they wish to be recommended items that have been rated highly, and has been shown to perform better than over algorithms whilst being less complex \cite{gori2007itemrank}.
